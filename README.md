# SlapGame

Mark Bridgeman <mark.bridgeman@gmail.com>

A demonstration of the BeeSlap game.  

My attempt here was to create as simple-as-possible an application to demonstrate the Bee Slap game, while retaining OOP principles, allow for future extensability but not result in bloated code.

What I hope this demonstrates is a clean use of subclasses and inheritance, and easy-to-follow code.

It's an interesting project, and a problem which I'm sure could result in a quite-complex solution depending on the developer.
