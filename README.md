# SlapGame

Mark Bridgeman <mark.bridgeman@gmail.com>

A demonstration of the BeeSlap game.  

My attempt here was to create as simple-as-possible an application to demonstrate the Bee Slap game, while retaining OOP principles, allow for future extensability but not result in bloated code.

What I hope this demonstrates is a clean use of subclasses and inheritance, and easy-to-follow code.

It's an interesting project, and a problem which I'm sure could result in a quite-complex solution depending on the developer. 

What should be included but unfortunately isn't, due to the short amount of time I've been able to devote to this test, is Exception handling and tests.
